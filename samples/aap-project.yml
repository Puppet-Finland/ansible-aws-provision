  # Value for the "Distro" tag. For example "Rocky" or "Ubuntu". The main
  # purpose of this variable is to allow creating keyed AWS EC2 inventory
  # groups which can then have group_vars that set ansible_user variable based
  # on the distro.
  distro: Ubuntu

  # Value of the "Name" tag for the instance. In other words, the human-readable
  # name of the EC2 instance that will be created.

  instance_type: t3.medium

  # SSH user that has passwordless sudo privileges. Typically the default user of
  # the AMI provider.

  # Try to cherry-pick what you transfer: the playbook uses ansible.builtin.copy
  # which is very slow when transfering lots of data (e.g. .git directories).

  # Comment out to not provision any files.
